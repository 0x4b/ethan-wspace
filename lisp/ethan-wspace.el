;; README that came with it.
;;
;; Editing whitespace. I don't like to forcibly clean[1] whitespace
;; because when doing diffs/checkins, it pollutes changesets. However,
;; I prefer clean whitespace -- often I've deleted whitespace by
;; accident and been unable to "put it back" for purposes of diffing.
;;
;; Therefore, my approach is hybrid -- maintain clean whitespace where
;; possible, and avoid disturbing messy whitespce when I come across
;; it. I add a find-file-hook to track whether the whitespace of a
;; given file was clean to begin with, and add a before-save-hook that
;; uses this information to forcibly clean whitespace only if it was
;; clean at start.
;;
;; Viewing whitespace. Originally I had a font-lock-mode hook that
;; always called show-trailing-whitespace and show-tabs, but this
;; turns out to be annoying for a lot of reasons. Emacs internal
;; buffers like *Completions* and *Shell* would get highlit. So I
;; decided that a more sophisticated approach was called for.
;;
;; 1) If a buffer does not correspond to a file, I almost certainly do
;; not care whether the whitespace is clean. I'm not going to be
;; saving it, after all.
;;
;; 2) If a buffer corresponds to a file that was originally clean, I
;; still don't really care about the whitespace, since my hook (above)
;; would ensure that it was clean going forward.
;;
;; 3) If a buffer corresponds to a file that was not originally clean,
;; I do care about seeing whitespace, because I do not want to edit it
;; by accident.
;;
;; There are a few exceptions -- if I'm looking at a patch, or hacking
;; a Makefile, whitespace is different. More about those later.
;;
;; This file adds hooks to make this stuff happen -- check whether the
;; whitespace is clean when a file is first found, and preserve that
;; cleanliness if so, and highlight that dirtiness if not. It does
;; this by setting show-trailing-whitespace when necessary.
;;
;; NOTE: take out any customizations like this:
;; '(show-trailing-whitespace t)
;; show-trailing-whitespace will be turned on by ethan-wspace.
;;
;; I would re-implement show-trailing-whitespace, but it's handled
;; specially by the emacs core. Probably just as well..
;;
;; FIXME: treat separately the trailing-whitespace, tabs, and
;; end-with-newline thing? But basically all three are the same --
;; check on find-file whether it's fine, and fix it if it is, and
;; highlight if it's not?
;;
;; FIXME: trailing-newlines aren't there at all?
;
; FIXME: These are all essentially minor modes, should be able to turn
; them off?
